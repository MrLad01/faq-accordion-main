## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap (CSS framework)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- React (JavaScript library)
- TypeScript (Programming language)

### What I learned

Throughout this project, I gained valuable experience in several areas:

Bootstrap Integration: Integrating Bootstrap with React allowed me to leverage its pre-built components and utility classes to create a responsive and visually appealing user interface. This project helped solidify my understanding of incorporating third-party libraries into React projects.

TypeScript Usage: Working with TypeScript provided additional type safety and improved code readability. Defining types for component props, state, and function parameters helped catch errors early in the development process and facilitated collaboration within the team.

CSS Customization: Customizing CSS styles to achieve the desired visual effects, such as hover and focus states, enhanced the overall user experience. Experimenting with CSS properties and selectors allowed me to fine-tune the appearance of the accordion components.

Accessibility Considerations: Ensuring keyboard navigation compatibility and implementing appropriate ARIA attributes improved the accessibility of the accordion component. This experience highlighted the importance of designing with accessibility in mind to accommodate users with disabilities.

By actively engaging with these concepts and technologies, I've expanded my skill set and feel more confident in my ability to develop responsive and accessible web applications.

### Continued development

While completing this project was a rewarding experience, there are still areas I aim to focus on for future projects:

Responsive Design Mastery: Continuing to hone my skills in responsive design will enable me to create web applications that adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices. Experimenting with CSS Grid, Flexbox, and media queries can further enhance my understanding of responsive layout techniques.

TypeScript Proficiency: Deepening my understanding of TypeScript's advanced features, such as generics, utility types, and conditional types, will enable me to write more robust and type-safe code. Delving into more complex type definitions and type inference scenarios can help me leverage TypeScript's full potential.
